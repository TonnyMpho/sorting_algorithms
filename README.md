## 0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O

### Tests

* Here is a quick tip to help you test your sorting algorithms with big sets of random integers: [Random.org](https://www.random.org/integer-sets/)

### Tasks

#### 0. Bubble sort

#### A function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Bubble sort algorithm

##### Prototype: void bubble_sort(int *array, size_t size);
* Expected to print the array after each time you swap two elements (See example below)
* In the file 0-O, the big O notations of the time complexity of the Bubble sort algorithm, with 1 notation per line:

 * in the best case
 * in the average case
 * in the worst case

#### 1. Insertion sort

#### A function that sorts a doubly linked list of integers in ascending order using the Insertion sort algorithm

##### Prototype: void insertion_sort_list(listint_t **list);
* Not allowed to modify the integer n of a node. You have to swap the nodes themselves.
* expected to print the list after each time you swap two elements (See example below)
* In the file 1-O, the big O notations of the time complexity of the Insertion sort algorithm, with 1 notation per line:

 * in the best case
 * in the average case
 * in the worst case

#### 2. Selection sort

#### A function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Selection sort algorithm

##### Prototype: void selection_sort(int *array, size_t size);
* expected to print the array after each time you swap two elements (See example below)
* In the file 2-O, the big O notations of the time complexity of the Selection sort algorithm, with 1 notation per line:

 * in the best case
 * in the average case
 * in the worst case

#### 3. Quick sort

#### A function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Quick sort algorithm

##### Prototype: void quick_sort(int *array, size_t size);
* Must implement the Lomuto partition scheme.
* The pivot should always be the last element of the partition being sorted.
* expected to print the array after each time you swap two elements (See example below)
* In the file 3-O, the big O notations of the time complexity of the Quick sort algorithm, with 1 notation per line:

 * in the best case
 * in the average case
 * in the worst case
